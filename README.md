**README.md**

**Getting Started**

This project is a React application for searching and adding books to a bookshelf. It uses the Open Library API to retrieve book information.

**Prerequisites**

- npm (or yarn) installed on your system. 

**Installation**

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ``` (or `yarn install`)

**Running the Application**

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ``` (or `yarn start`)

   This will start the development server, typically running on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

**Usage**

1. Enter a book title or keyword in the search bar.
2. Click the "Search" button or press Enter.
3. If results are found, they will be displayed in a list format.
4. Click the "Add to Bookshelf" button next to a book to add it to your bookshelf (implementation might require additional features like storing books in localStorage).

**Additional Notes**

- This is a basic setup for a React project with search and addition functionalities.
- Customize the application further by adding features like displaying book covers, adding filters to the search, or implementing user authentication.
- Consider using a state management library like Redux or Context API to manage complex application state.
